Part 3
1) The bug was that when someone tried to sum up two numbers, it summed teh string of the numbers, not the integers themselves, so the sum would be false. As an example, 3 + 3 would evaluate to 33, since the program was doing "3" + "3".<br/>
2) To fix this, I just made sure when asking for the numbers, than they get parsed as ints, so when they enter the sum function, the integers are in teh fuction, so the proper sum can be calculated<br/>
